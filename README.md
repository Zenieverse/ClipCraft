# ClipCraft
ClipCraft is an Arm-optimized, fully on-device AI video editor that brings semantic editing, auto-captioning, scene analysis, and cinematic style transfer directly into a mobile workflow. By combining quantized models, NNAPI acceleration, Vulkan GPU delegates, and a real-time video inference pipeline, it pushes the limits of what Arm hardware can run locally. The UX is simple, production-ready, and designed for creators: tap an object to edit it, tap “Director Mode” to auto-cut and enhance your entire clip. ClipCraft not only delivers a magical user experience—it provides modular open-source building blocks that empower the entire developer community to build next-generation mobile AI applications.

# ClipCraft — On-Device AI Video Editor & Director (Arm AI Developer Challenge 2025)

**One-line:** ClipCraft is an Arm-optimized, fully on-device AI video editor that provides one-tap Director mode, semantic object editing, auto-captions & summaries, and GPU-accelerated cinematic style filters — all running locally on Arm-based phones/tablets.

## 📌 Why ClipCraft
ClipCraft demonstrates that complex multi-model video AI pipelines (segmentation, temporal inpainting, STT, summarization, style transfer) can run efficiently and privately on Arm devices using TFLite, NNAPI, GPU delegates, and Arm NN optimizations. It’s both a user-facing app and an open-source toolbox for mobile AI developers.

## 🚀 Highlights (Judging-aligned)
- **Technological Implementation:** quantized int8 models, NNAPI/Vulkan GPU delegates, Arm NN/Compute Library / NEON fallback, memory-mapped assets, streaming video pipeline.
- **User Experience:** one-tap Director mode, tap-to-edit semantic UI, real-time previews, export to standard MP4.
- **Potential Impact:** modular components (segmentation, inpainting, style models, STT, summarizer) reusable by the community.
- **WOW Factor:** semantic object removal and story-driven auto-editing working locally — no cloud needed.
